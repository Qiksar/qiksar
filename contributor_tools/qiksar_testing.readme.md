# Testing the Qiksar scaffold process

When contributors commit code, it is essential to test that the Qiksar scaffold process works, i.e. it produces error free code.

On your development machine it is recommended to have the following file structure

dev <- Your home folder for development work
demo <- Your home folder where you test Qiksar and make training videos
demo/qiksar <- Where you clone the Qiksar repo to test it works
demo/app <- Where you move the Qiksar generated app, so that you can test it in an isolated folder away from Qiksar itself
